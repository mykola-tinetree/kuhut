# kuhut - The Culture of Learning.

kuhut is a project designed to build a global online learning platform, accessible by everyone, with the aim of helping to create a more equal opportunity world.

The platform will be targeted at the elementary learners, as well as the professionals wishing to up-skill or re-skill, and will focus on the following three aspects of learning:

1) __Assessing__ the user's current knowledge of a certain topic,

2) finding personalised ways to __Motivate__ them, and

3) providing the necessary resources to __Educate__ and fill the gaps in their knowledge.

The innovation lies in the fact that all three of these aspects - Assess, Motivate, Educate - will be applied simultaneously at each step of the learning journey. This can be done by continually constructing a detailed graph of a user's knowledge of any topic or subject, and using Artificial Intelligence to find the most effective paths between their current knowledge and learning preferences, and their desired knowledge and skills.

## Details

Learning is a lifelong process.

The typical journey of going to school, getting a job, and working for the same employer until retirement, is becoming less viable as a way to build a strong dynamic economy. Therefore, more people nowadays choose to up-skill and re-skill, as they progress from challenge to challenge in their daily life and work. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the tremendous job losses in a number of well-established industries, have highlighted just how critical this continuous learning and re-skilling will be for the future of the British economy, as well as other economies the world over.

While there is a growing number of educational resources on the internet, the vast majority of them still follow the same 'subject'-based approach. But which subject does one learn if they want to move from, say, the hospitality industry to IT project management?

This is where _kuhut_ comes in.

The very core of _kuhut_ is designed with a single, simple purpose - to help you learn as effectively and as productively as possible. Instead of flooding you with 'things that you need to remember', it is entirely focused on first of all understanding your current level of knowledge, as well as finding the best paths to grow from where you are, to where you want to be.

Let your learning be driven by your own curiosity!
